# Tododo Note Taking App

A seemingly simple note taking app using React. I'm gonna polish this until it turns into abomination of features that have no business being there.

# Todo practice

## Features

### Edit

### Drag and Drop

### Themes with base react

### ~Button Action~

Delete and Enter work on base page (no highlighted element)

## Back-end

### Login

### Send note to email

SendGrid? MailChimp??

## React

### ~useEffect~

On keypress event. Worked

### useContext

### ~useRef~

Got content from sub component into App.jsx

### useMemo

## Running the Project

1. **Install dependencies**  
   Navigate to the `tododo` directory and install dependencies:

    ```sh
    cd tododo
    npm install
    ```

2. **Start the development server**  
   Run the following command to start the app:

    ```sh
    npm run dev

3. **Open in browser**  
   Visit the local address shown in your terminal (usually [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)) to view the app.
